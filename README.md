# Writing Samples - Jeffrey Cowles

The PDF files in this repository are a few samples of the different types of documentation that I've written and are organized into loose categories. I included a variety of writing styles (beyond just technical documentation) to demonstrate my range and ability to adapt to the needs of different audiences.  

> **Note:** There is significant work I've done in the last eight years for which I do not have examples. This work included API documentation, and although unfortunate, it couldn't be helped; the company I worked for had very strict policies about downloading content from the organization's network and I need to honor the agreement I signed. Of course, I'm happy to verbally explain these materials.  

## User Documentation

### 01_ACE_User_Guide.pdf

This 15-page guide documents an organization's new Administrative Center for Excellence (ACE) system. The guide orients users to the new system and summarizes basic tasks related to purchasing.
	
### 02_User-Guide_from_Online-Help.pdf

This guide documents an application used to track and maintain ski areas on land managed by a large U.S. government agency.  I wrote the content in this guide as single-source articles in RoboHelp and then published them to an online help system and also to this PDF.     
	
### 03_Quickguide_Attachments.pdf

This document described how to upload documents to a web-based asset management platform and attach them to specific records. The content was single-sourced in RoboHelp and published as online help articles and as a downloadable PDF. 

## Technical Documentation

### 04_Conky-Help.pdf

This documentation is the result of a small, personal project to create an informational overlay window used on my personal Linux laptop using the Conky software. All documentation was written according to the DITA standard using the open source XML Copy Editor and then generated to both PDF and Markdown using the DITA OT engine. See the project [here](https://github.com/wigwami/conky-files).
		
### 05_Application_Hosting_Process_Excerpt.pdf

This document contains two excerpts from a larger series of articles that described the process for migrating legacy applications to a new, centralized application hosting environment. This document was crucial for reassuring the owners of these legacy applications that the process was very well tested, their data would be save, and their user base would be supported.       

## Leadership & Executive Communications

### 06_Project_Talking_Points.pdf | 07_Executive_Brief.pdf | 08_Program_Accomplishments.pdf

I generated these three documents for a major data center migration project for a U.S. government agency. This project was extremely important to the agency and had high visibility at the executive level. The project talking points gave stakeholders a high-level overview of the project and its focus. I published the executive brief quarterly to update executives on the progress of important tasks. The program accomplishments was a yearly publication to highlight advancements and next steps.    
	
### 09_Process_Flow.pdf

I generated this simple flow using Microsoft Visio to describe the plan-write-review-publish process for a technical writing team I managed. It's "swim lane" layout shows the various steps in the process and where the different responsible parties (writers, reviewers, etc.) perform their tasks.   

## Training

### 10_Training_Script.pdf

I wrote this training script for leading bio-research company. It's intended for use during an online session where the trainer guides attendees through significant changes made to the company's HR system.
